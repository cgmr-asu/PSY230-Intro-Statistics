# PSY230-Intro-Statistics
This repo contains materials used for Carson's Introduction to Statistics course taught through the Department of Psychology at Arizona State University.

The activities directory contains jupyter notebooks adapted from materials used as weekly in-class activities in the course. In many cases, these activities are autonomous -- they can be worked through independently by students with little or no introduction. In other cases, they form part of a larger group activity.


Week 0 - ASU PSY230: Phoenix Neighborhoods
  A first look at R code with Google Colab; serves as a "first day success" activity for students with no or little background in scientific computing; students explore census tract data from across Phoenix to identify neighborhoods with indicators of high vulnerability to extreme heat and to find socioeconomic and other covariates of these vulnerability indicators.
